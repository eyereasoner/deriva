% Deontic logic: obligations, prohibitions, compensations, and violations.
% The example separates normative facts from observed actions.  Missing an
% obligation and performing a prohibited action are violations, but a prohibited
% action can be marked compensated when the configured repair action occurred.

materialize(compensation, 2).
