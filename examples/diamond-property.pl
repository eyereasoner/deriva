% Diamond property, adapted from Eyelet's input/diamond-property.pl.
%
% A relation has the diamond property when two outgoing steps from the same
% source can be joined again.  This compact via version keeps the same
% diamond idea and also checks that it is preserved by reflexive closure.

% Output declarations: materialize/2 selects the relations written to this example's golden output.
materialize(holdsFor, 2).
materialize(commonSuccessor, 2).
materialize(preservedUnderReflexiveClosure, 2).

% Program structure: facts set up the scenario, and rules derive the materialized conclusions.
node(a).
node(b).
node(c).
node(d).

r(a, b).
r(a, c).
r(b, d).
r(c, d).

% Derivation rules: each rule below contributes one logical step toward the displayed results.
re(X, X) :- node(X).
re(X, Y) :- r(X, Y).

diamond(Rel, A, B, C, D) :-
  step(Rel, A, B),

step(r, X, Y) :- r(X, Y).
step(re, X, Y) :- re(X, Y).

holdsFor(diamondProperty, Rel) :- diamond(Rel, a, b, c, d).
commonSuccessor(diamondProperty, D) :- diamond(r, a, b, c, D).
