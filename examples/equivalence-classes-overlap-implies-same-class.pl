% Equivalence-class overlap example adapted from Eyeling.
%
% The finite classMember/2 facts represent an already-computed equivalence
% closure.  sameClassBecauseOfSharedMember/3 reports the witness Z proving that
% X and Y belong to the same class because both contain that shared member.
%
% This is useful for proof output: the conclusion is not just that two class
% labels coincide, but also which element explains the overlap.
