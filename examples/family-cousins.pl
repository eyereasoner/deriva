% Family-cousins derivation adapted from Eyeling family-cousins.n3.
% Generation numbers are derived from parent links; branch labels distinguish
% descendants of Bob from descendants of Carol.
% The family tree and seed branch labels are quoted as a small formula term, so
% the rules derive from scoped family data rather than global relationship facts.
