% Order-theory proof sketch: greatest lower bounds are unique.
%
% Two candidate GLBs are asserted for the same pair.  The rules derive that
% each must be below the other, then use antisymmetry-style sameTerm/2 reasoning
% to report that the candidates denote the same lower bound.
materialize(sameGreatestLowerBound, 4).

% Adapted from Eyeling greatest-lower-bound-uniqueness.n3.  The named facts
% intentionally use two different symbols, g1 and g2, so the final output shows
% the equality-style conclusion as an explicit derived relation.

glbOf(g2, a, b).

% leq/2 captures the defining property of a GLB: every lower bound is below it.
