% Technology example: Hamming(7,4) single-bit error correction.
%
% The received word has one corrupted bit. Syndrome bits identify the bad
% position, then the corrected codeword and decoded payload are derived.

% Output declarations: materialize/2 selects the relations written to this example's golden output.
%
% Positions are one-based to match the textbook parity-check layout. The
% syndrome value is both the error certificate and the index of the bit to fix.
