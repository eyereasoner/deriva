% Intuitionistic logic emulation with a finite Kripke model.

% The preorder leq/2 represents information growth: later worlds contain at
% least as much information as earlier worlds.  Atomic facts persist upward, and
% implication is checked at every future world.  This lets the example show a
% constructive implication that holds while excluded middle is not forced at the
% root world.
