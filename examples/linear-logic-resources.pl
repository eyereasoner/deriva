% Linear logic emulation with explicit consumable resources.
%
% Via predicates are reusable Horn clauses, so this example represents the
% linear part explicitly as a multiset-like state list.  A rule consumes its
% input resources with select/3 and produces a new state.  If a resource is not
% present, the step fails, which models the “use exactly once” discipline of
% linear implication.
%
% The successful plan turns wheat, yeast, and heat into bread.  The rejected
% double-spend check shows that one coin cannot be consumed by two purchases.

materialize(linear_check, 2).

initial(kitchen, [wheat, yeast, heat]).
initial(wallet, [coin]).

% linear_rule(Name, Inputs, Outputs) is an encoded linear implication:
% Inputs -o Outputs, evaluated against the current resource state.

% consume_all/3 removes each required resource once.  This is the key linear
% operation: a second attempt to use the same token cannot succeed.
