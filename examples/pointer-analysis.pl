% Andersen-style inclusion-based pointer analysis.
%
% The program being analyzed has address-taking, assignment, store, and load
% statements.  The logic rules compute a fixed point of points_to/2 and
% field_points_to/2 facts.  This is the classic Datalog shape used in scalable
% pointer-analysis papers, reduced to a small readable instance.

%   r = q
addr(x, object_a).

% Store and load constraints.  If y may point to object_a and z may point to
% object_b, then object_a's abstract field may point to object_b.  A later load
% from x therefore gives q the same target.
