% Register allocation as bounded graph coloring with spilling.
%
% Production allocators combine liveness analysis, interference graphs, register
% classes, coalescing, rematerialization, and spill-code insertion.  This Via
% example reduces the problem to its logical core: enumerate assignments of a
% few temporaries to two registers or memory, reject register conflicts, and use
% aggregate_min/5 to choose the cheapest spill plan.

% Two physical registers are available.  The synthetic place spill means the
