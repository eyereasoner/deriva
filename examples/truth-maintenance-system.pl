% A tiny assumption-based truth maintenance system.

% An environment is a set of assumptions.  Justifications derive beliefs from
% assumptions and from other derived beliefs.  The TMS can therefore explain
% which environments support a belief and which environments are inconsistent
% because they support contradictory conclusions.
