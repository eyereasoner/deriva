% Wolf, goat and cabbage puzzle, adapted from Eyelet's
% input/wolf-goat-cabbage.pl.
%
% A configuration is [man, wolf, goat, cabbage], where each item is on the west
% bank w or east bank e.  The recursive search keeps a visited list so via
% explores the finite state space without looping.

% Output declarations: materialize/2 selects the relations written to this example's golden output.
materialize(solution, 2).
materialize(solved, 2).

% Program structure: facts set up the scenario, and rules derive the materialized conclusions.

% Derivation rules: each rule below contributes one logical step toward the displayed results.
