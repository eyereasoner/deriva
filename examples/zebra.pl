% Zebra puzzle, adapted from Eyelet's input/zebra.pl.
%
% Five houses are represented as house(Color, Nationality, Pet, Beverage,
% Cigarette).  Each clue is a member/2, first/2, third/2, next_to/3, or adjacent/3
% constraint over that list.  The answer is the classic one: the Norwegian drinks
% water and the Japanese owns the zebra.

% Output declarations: materialize/2 selects the relations written to this example's golden output.
materialize(waterDrinker, 2).
materialize(zebraOwner, 2).
materialize(solved, 2).

% The single zebra/2 rule is a finite constraint model over the five house slots.
zebra(Waterdrinker, Zebraowner) :-
  eq(Houses, [_, _, _, _, _]),
  first(Houses, house(_, norwegian, _, _, _)),
  third(Houses, house(_, _, _, milk, _)),
  adjacent(house(_, norwegian, _, _, _), house(blue, _, _, _, _), Houses),
  next_to(house(ivory, _, _, _, _), house(green, _, _, _, _), Houses),
  member(house(red, english, _, _, _), Houses),
  member(house(green, _, _, coffee, _), Houses),
  member(house(yellow, _, _, _, kools), Houses),
